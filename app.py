### Chart Explanation
chart_explained = """
Sentiment valence, a scale between -1 and 1, measures the emotional tone of text. A score of -1 represents extreme negativity, while 1 indicates extreme positivity. Values closer to 0 signify neutrality. This scale helps quantify sentiments in language, which is useful in Natural Language Processing tasks like sentiment analysis, as used here on the headlines from each of the news sources.

    ### SA Explained
    sa_defined = """
    Imagine you're watching a series of movie scenes, and after each scene, you're asked to turn a dial based on how the scene made you feel. If the scene made you feel really positive and happy, you'd turn the dial all the way to the right, let's say to the number 1. If the scene made you feel very negative or sad, you'd turn the dial all the way to the left, to the number -1. If the scene didn't make you feel particularly one way or the other, you'd leave the dial in the middle, around 0. The Sentiment Valence value from a sentiment analysis model is like that dial. It's a score that tells us how positive or negative a piece of text is. If a piece of writing has a score close to 1, it's very positive. If it's close to -1, it's very negative. Anything that falls between -0.1 and 0.1 is considered neutral, meaning the text doesn't swing strongly toward happy or sad feelings‚Äîit's more in the middle. In simple terms, Sentiment Valence is like a mood ring for text: it gives us a quick read on whether the text feels happy, sad, or somewhere in between.

    ### Methods explained
    how_it_works = """
    Each of the news sources mentioned in the graph above posts several news headlines, which are all posted on specific webpages. The headlines from these webpages are collected through something called Web Scraping. Sentiment Analysis is then performed to quantify how 'negative', 'positive', and 'neutral' each headline is, and these sentiment valencies are then aggregated across each day's posts, which gives us the daily average sentiment valence. This is what is shown in the graph, above.

    compound_explained = """
    This is what is actually shown in the graph, above. This score is not a value provided by the Sentiment Analysis model, directly, but instead is a value calculated using each of the positive, negative, and neutral scores. To calculate the compound sentiment score of a headline we subtract the 'negative' score from the 'positive' score, and then multiply the difference by 1 minus the 'neutral' score of the headline. See the formula, below.
